    <h1>DeepSeek – AI  Bifurcation (Continued)</h1>
    <p><strong>Rewriting the playbook on AI competition. </strong>The view of the economic structure of AI is changing.<strong> </strong> What DeepSeek has demonstrated is a different way to play the AI story, where the entry requirements for AI product and services are no longer as high as the story (perception) suggested.  We think this goes beyond the company, the Chinese origin, or the cost, but simply the realization that part of the AI story is no longer true anymore.  It’s innovation vs. who has the most money now. The winner takes all has instead become a more competitive industry and where profits are shared and much of the value will be captured by consumers and not companies. We have reached an era where users are now able to run a high-performing LLM themselves, eliminating the need for data, leading to more use of AI. We call this the 'low-cost AI' market which will commoditize rapidly as a lot of people will enter that market, and good news for the consumer of AI, but it is going to be very difficult to make money in that segment.</p>
    
    <h2>How could a 'low-cost  AI' market play out?</h2>
    <p><strong>Profitless prosperity...</strong> It is going to be very difficult to make money in the low-cost AI segment – winners and losers in this market may be similar to retail, where coming up with sustainable competitive advantages will be key when the entry cost is low and the offering is essentially the same as everybody else's. As every AI model incorporates every DeepSeek-like refresh all within few weeks of each other, everyone will eventually have access to similar reasoning models. We have already seen this play out in text-to-speech offering where no one pays for it anymore; the same for stable diffusion, which is suddenly not worth anything as it has become widely available. We can go further and think of about 50 things humans do in daily life and once 'AI agents' built into smartphones have AL inference capabilities to solve these 50 things, there may be little value after that.</p>
    
    <h2>China's diverging path on AI</h2>
    <p><strong>China's diverging path on AI.</strong> China’s long-term goal is to build an indigenous AI ecosystem that can compete globally without relying on Western technologies. There is now a critical mass of machine learning expertise in China that is capable of creating advances that haven’t occurred in the world of AI – companies like Alibaba Cloud, Tencent, Moonshot AI, Zhipu or ByteDance are few examples of companies able to match DeepSeek's capabilities and impact.</p>
    
    <h2>Stock implications</h2>
    <p>We think DeepSeek represents a validation of China's Innovation 2.0, a new era of homegrown technological leadership driven by a younger generation of entrepreneurs. It is hard to have a differentiated bullish view on leading AI stocks that worked previously entering year 3 and timing is tough, but we’ve had many winners outside of AI and they can quietly keep working under this new story post DeepSeek. China technology valuation is inexpensive, there is still stimulus on the horizon and DeepSeek may give a new life to edge AI, China software, data centers, and cloud providers.</p>
    
    <h3>Key AI Growth Factors in China</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Infrastructure with 26% of world's computing power.</li>
        <li>Data growing 26% CAGR.</li>
        <li>Technology with 188 foundational models registered at the national level as of August 2024.</li>
        <li>energy abundance with 22% increase in the total number of green data centers in 2023.</li>
        <li>Talent development with 47% of the world's top AI research in China.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>DeepSeek is driving the bifurcation of share performance within AI beneficiaries, but we think the market winners will be those that scale up and commercialize new breakthroughs rapidly.</p>
